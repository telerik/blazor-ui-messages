# UI for Blazor: Translation of Messages

## Overview

This repo contains sample localization messages for the Telerik UI for Blazor component suite.

> The resource files here are community contributions that may need updating. For up-to-date `.resx` files, please refer to the [**Notes** section below](#notes).

You can read more on how localization works for them in the dedicated <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization" target="_blank">Localization</a> documentation article - it explains how to add the necessary localization service in your Blazor application and how to find the up-to-date list of keys from our demos.

You can also find sample projects in the <a href="https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/localization" target="_blank">Telerik UI for Blazor Sample Projects repo: Localization</a>.

## Notes

The Telerik UI for Blazor library evolves quickly, with many new features and components being added constantly. 

This means that translations created at a given point in time may not contain all strings used in newer versions, so you may need to amend them.

If you do so, feel free to contribute your work.

You can find an up-to-date list of the used strings in our [API documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/api/Telerik.Blazor.Resources.Messages) and the [offline version](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads) of our [Demo solution](http://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/). Telerik maintains the main`TelerikMessages.resx` file (in English) to have the full list with each release.
