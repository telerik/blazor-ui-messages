# UI for Blazor: Translation of Messages

## Overview

This repo contains sample localization messages for the Telerik UI for Blazor component suite.

You can read more on how localization works for them in the dedicated <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization" target="_blank">Localization</a> documentation article - it explains how to add the necessary localization service in your application and how to find the up-to-date list of keys from our demos.

You can also find sample projects in the <a href="https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/localization" target="_blank">Telerik UI for Blazor Sample Projects repo: Localization</a>.

## Notes

The Telerik UI for Blazor suite evolves quickly, with many new features and components being added constantly. 

This means that translations created at a given point in time may not contain all strings used in newer versions, so you may need to amend them.

If you do so, feel free to contribute your work.

You can find an up-to-date list of the used strings in the demos solution we provide. Telerik maintains the main `Messages.resx` file to have the full list with each release.
